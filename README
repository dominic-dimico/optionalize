The optionalize program is a simple tool for generating getopts code and parts
of manual pages.  It makes it very easy to create programs which accept options
via the command line.  In the case of the C language, ten lines of C code are
generated for every one line of an optionalize configuration file. 

To install optionalize, clone it from GitHub, then follow the instructions in
the INSTALL file:

  git clone http://github.com/dominic-dimico/optionalize.git

Optionalize requires a plain-text options description file (.opt) giving a
minimum-length description of options to be supported.  An example is provided
in the examples/ folder of this source package.  See the manual page
optionalize(1) for details on its invocation.
